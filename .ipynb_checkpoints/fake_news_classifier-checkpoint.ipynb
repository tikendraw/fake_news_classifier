      "secrets of the us election assange talks to pilger november 5, 2016 wikileaks founder julian assange denies the russian government was the source of leaked emails about hillary clinton and says her neomccarthy russiabashing is just part of a coverup, in an interview with john pilger. by john pilger this interview was filmed in the embassy of ecuador in london where julian assange is a political refugee and broadcast on nov. 5, 2016 john pilger whats the significance of the fbis intervention in these last days of the u.s. election campaign, in the case against hillary clinton wikileaks founder julian assange. photo credit espen moe julian assange if you look at the history of the fbi, it has become effectively americas political police. the fbi demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the cia general david petraeus over classified information given to his mistress. almost no one is untouchable. the fbi is always trying to demonstrate that no one can resist us. but hillary clinton very conspicuously resisted the fbis investigation, so theres anger within the fbi because it made the fbi look weak. weve published about 33,000 of clintons emails when she was secretary of state. they come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, of which clinton has kept about half 30,000 to herself, and weve published about half. then there are the podesta emails weve been publishing. john podesta is hillary clintons primary campaign manager, so theres a thread that runs through all these emails there are quite a lot of payforplay, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. these emails are combined with the coverup of the hillary clinton emails when she was secretary of state, which has led to an environment where the pressure on the fbi increases. john pilger the clinton campaign has said that russia is behind all of this, that russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for wikileaks and its emails. julian assange the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neomccarthy hysteria that russia is responsible for everything. hilary clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 had assessed that russia was the source of our publications. that is false we can say that the russian government is not the source. wikileaks has been publishing for ten years, and in those ten years, we have published ten million documents, several thousand individual publications, several thousand different sources, and we have never got it wrong. john pilger the emails that give evidence of access for money and how hillary clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. im thinking of when the qatari representative was given five minutes with bill clinton for a million dollar cheque. julian assange and twelve million dollars from morocco john pilger twelve million from morocco yeah. julian assange for hillary clinton to attend a party. john pilger in terms of the foreign policy of the united states, thats where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of isil, in the middle east. can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of isil, are actually those who have helped create it. speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at carl hayden high school in phoenix, arizona, by gage skidmore julian assange theres an early 2014 email from hillary clinton, not so long after she left the state department, to her campaign manager john podesta that states isil is funded by the governments of saudi arabia and qatar. now this is email in the whole collection, and perhaps because saudi and qatari money is spread all over the clinton foundation. even the u.s. government agrees that some saudi figures have been supporting isil, or isis. but the dodge has always been that, well its just some rogue princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. but that email says that no, it is the governments of saudi and qatar that have been funding isis. john pilger the saudis, the qataris, the moroccans, the bahrainis, particularly the saudis and the qataris, are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hilary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to saudi arabia. julian assange under hillary clinton, the worlds largest ever arms deal was made with saudi arabia, worth more than 80 billion. in fact, during her tenure as secretary of state, total arms exports from the united states in terms of the dollar value, doubled. john pilger of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the clinton foundation. julian assange yes. john pilger thats extraordinary. julian assange i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions. she represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. the question is how does hilary clinton fit in this broader network shes a centralizing cog. youve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like goldman sachs and major elements of wall street, and intelligence and people in the state department and the saudis. shes the centralizer that interconnects all these different cogs. shes the smooth central representation of all that, and all that is more or less what is in power now in the united states. its what we call the establishment or the dc consensus. one of the more significant podesta emails that we released was about how the obama cabinet was formed and how half the obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from citibank. this is quite amazing. john pilger didnt citibank supply a list . julian assange yes. john pilger which turned out to be most of the obama cabinet. julian assange yes. john pilger so wall street decides the cabinet of the president of the united states julian assange if you were following the obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. julian assange so i think you cant properly understand hillary clintons foreign policy without understanding saudi arabia. the connections with saudi arabia are so intimate. u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton meets with saudi king abdullah in riyadh on march 30, 2012. state department photo john pilger why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of libya can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us, told you about what happened there, because libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in syria, the isil jihadism and so on, and it was almost hillary clintons invasion. what do the emails tell us about thatjulian assange libya, more than anyone elses war, was hillary clintons war. barak obama initially opposed it. who was the person championing it hillary clinton. thats documented throughout her emails. she had put her favored agent, sidney blumenthal, on to that theres more than 1,700 emails out of the 33,000 hillary clinton emails that weve published, just about libya. its not that libya has cheap oil. she perceived the removal of gaddafi and the overthrow of the libyan state something that she would use in her runup to the general election for president. so in late 2011 there is an internal document called the libya tick tock that was produced for hillary clinton, and its the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within libya jihadists moved in, isis moved in, leading to the european refugee and migrant crisis. not only did you have people fleeing libya, people fleeing syria, the destabilization of other african countries as a result of arms flows, but the libyan state itself was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. libya faces along to the mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of africa. so all problems, economic problems and civil war in africa previously people fleeing those problems didnt end up in europe because libya policed the mediterranean. that was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by gaddafi what do these europeans think theyre doing, trying to bomb and destroy the libyan state theres going to be floods of migrants out of africa and jihadists into europe, and this is exactly what happened. john pilger you get complaints from people saying, what is wikileaks doing are they trying to put trump in the white house julian assange my answer is that trump would not be permitted to win. why do i say that because hes had every establishment off side trump doesnt have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence agencies, arms companies big foreign money are all united behind hillary clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. j ohn pilger there is the accusation that wikileaks is in league with the russians. some people say, well, why doesnt wikileaks investigate and publish emails on russia julian assange we have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to russia. most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia, most of which are critical. our russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia, which they use our documents to back up. john pilger do you yourself take a view of the u.s. election do you have a preference for clinton or trump donald trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at the arizona state fairgrounds in phoenix, arizona. june 18, 2016. photo by gage skidmore julian assange lets talk about donald trump. what does he represent in the american mind and in the european mind he represents american white trash, which hillary clinton called deplorable and irredeemable. it means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. because he so clearly through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies represents people who are not the middle, not the uppermiddle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting trump in any way, including any criticism of hillary clinton. if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. john pilger id like to talk about ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in london. now ecuador has cut off the internet from here where were doing this interview, in the embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the u.s. election campaign. can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on ecuadors support for you julian assange lets let go back four years. i made an asylum application to ecuador in this embassy, because of the u.s. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, i was successful in my asylum application. the embassy since then has been surrounded by police quite an expensive police operation which the british government admits to spending more than 12.6 million. they admitted that over a year ago. now theres undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of london between ecuador, a country of 16 million people, and the united kingdom, and the americans who have been helping on the side. so that was a brave and principled thing for ecuador to do. now we have the u.s. election campaign, the ecuadorian election is in february next year, and you have the white house feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. wikileaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of ecuador we publish from france, we publish from, from germany, we publish from the netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on wikileaks is through my refugee status and this is, this is really intolerable. it means that they are trying to get at a publishing organization they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the american people and others about an election. ecuadoran president rafael correa. john pilger tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. julian assange i would be immediately arrested by the british police and i would then be extradited either immediately or to sweden. in sweden i am not charged, i have already been previously cleared by the senior stockholm prosecutor eva finne. we were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the u.s. has requested since at least 2000. so over the last 15 years, every single person the u.s. has tried to extradite from sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee that wont happen. john pilger people often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. julian assange look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that theyre adaptable one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. they adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. so in my situation, frankly, im a bit institutionalized this the embassy is the world its visually the world for me. john pilger its the world without sunlight, for one thing, isnt it julian assange its the world without sunlight, but i havent seen sunlight in so long, i dont remember it. john pilger yes. julian assange so, yes, you adapt. the one real irritant is that my young children they also adapt. they adapt to being without their father. thats a hard, hard adaption which they didnt ask for. john pilger do you worry about them julian assange yes, i worry about them i worry about their mother. john pilger some people would say, well, why dont you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to sweden julian assange the u.n. the united nations working group on arbitrary detention has looked into this whole situation. they spent 18 months in formal, adversarial litigation. so its me and the u.n. versus sweden and the u.k. whos right the u.n. made a conclusion that i am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the united kingdom and sweden, and that those countries must obey. it is an illegal abuse. it is the united nations formally asking, whats going on here what is your legal explanation for this assange says that you should recognize his asylum. and here is sweden formally writing back to the united nations to say, no, were not going to recognize the un ruling, so leaving open their ability to extradite. i just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publicly in the press, because it doesnt suit the western establishment narrative that yes, the west has political prisoners, its a reality, its not just me, theres a bunch of other people as well. the west has political prisoners. of course, no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. they dont call them political prisoners in china, they dont call them political prisoners in azerbaijan and they dont call them political prisoners in the united states, u.k. or sweden it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of selfperception. julian assange here we have a case, the swedish case, where i have never been charged with a crime, where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum. those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric john pilger yes, its different. julian assange the rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that i have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that i have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. the rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the u.n. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, i am subject to persecution by the united states. john pilger is an australianbritish journalist based in london. pilgers web site is www.johnpilger.com . to support julian assange, go to httpsjustice4assange.comdonate.html\n",

      "sentence:  secrets of the us election assange talks to pilger november 5, 2016 wikileaks founder julian assange denies the russian government was the source of leaked emails about hillary clinton and says her neomccarthy russiabashing is just part of a coverup, in an interview with john pilger. by john pilger this interview was filmed in the embassy of ecuador in london where julian assange is a political refugee and broadcast on nov. 5, 2016 john pilger whats the significance of the fbis intervention in these last days of the u.s. election campaign, in the case against hillary clinton wikileaks founder julian assange. photo credit espen moe julian assange if you look at the history of the fbi, it has become effectively americas political police. the fbi demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the cia general david petraeus over classified information given to his mistress. almost no one is untouchable. the fbi is always trying to demonstrate that no one can resist us. but hillary clinton very conspicuously resisted the fbis investigation, so theres anger within the fbi because it made the fbi look weak. weve published about 33,000 of clintons emails when she was secretary of state. they come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, of which clinton has kept about half 30,000 to herself, and weve published about half. then there are the podesta emails weve been publishing. john podesta is hillary clintons primary campaign manager, so theres a thread that runs through all these emails there are quite a lot of payforplay, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. these emails are combined with the coverup of the hillary clinton emails when she was secretary of state, which has led to an environment where the pressure on the fbi increases. john pilger the clinton campaign has said that russia is behind all of this, that russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for wikileaks and its emails. julian assange the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neomccarthy hysteria that russia is responsible for everything. hilary clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 had assessed that russia was the source of our publications. that is false we can say that the russian government is not the source. wikileaks has been publishing for ten years, and in those ten years, we have published ten million documents, several thousand individual publications, several thousand different sources, and we have never got it wrong. john pilger the emails that give evidence of access for money and how hillary clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. im thinking of when the qatari representative was given five minutes with bill clinton for a million dollar cheque. julian assange and twelve million dollars from morocco john pilger twelve million from morocco yeah. julian assange for hillary clinton to attend a party. john pilger in terms of the foreign policy of the united states, thats where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of isil, in the middle east. can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of isil, are actually those who have helped create it. speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at carl hayden high school in phoenix, arizona, by gage skidmore julian assange theres an early 2014 email from hillary clinton, not so long after she left the state department, to her campaign manager john podesta that states isil is funded by the governments of saudi arabia and qatar. now this is email in the whole collection, and perhaps because saudi and qatari money is spread all over the clinton foundation. even the u.s. government agrees that some saudi figures have been supporting isil, or isis. but the dodge has always been that, well its just some rogue princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. but that email says that no, it is the governments of saudi and qatar that have been funding isis. john pilger the saudis, the qataris, the moroccans, the bahrainis, particularly the saudis and the qataris, are giving all this money to the clinton foundation while hilary clinton is secretary of state and the state department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to saudi arabia. julian assange under hillary clinton, the worlds largest ever arms deal was made with saudi arabia, worth more than 80 billion. in fact, during her tenure as secretary of state, total arms exports from the united states in terms of the dollar value, doubled. john pilger of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called isil or isis is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the clinton foundation. julian assange yes. john pilger thats extraordinary. julian assange i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions. she represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. the question is how does hilary clinton fit in this broader network shes a centralizing cog. youve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like goldman sachs and major elements of wall street, and intelligence and people in the state department and the saudis. shes the centralizer that interconnects all these different cogs. shes the smooth central representation of all that, and all that is more or less what is in power now in the united states. its what we call the establishment or the dc consensus. one of the more significant podesta emails that we released was about how the obama cabinet was formed and how half the obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from citibank. this is quite amazing. john pilger didnt citibank supply a list . julian assange yes. john pilger which turned out to be most of the obama cabinet. julian assange yes. john pilger so wall street decides the cabinet of the president of the united states julian assange if you were following the obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. julian assange so i think you cant properly understand hillary clintons foreign policy without understanding saudi arabia. the connections with saudi arabia are so intimate. u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton meets with saudi king abdullah in riyadh on march 30, 2012. state department photo john pilger why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of libya can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us, told you about what happened there, because libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in syria, the isil jihadism and so on, and it was almost hillary clintons invasion. what do the emails tell us about thatjulian assange libya, more than anyone elses war, was hillary clintons war. barak obama initially opposed it. who was the person championing it hillary clinton. thats documented throughout her emails. she had put her favored agent, sidney blumenthal, on to that theres more than 1,700 emails out of the 33,000 hillary clinton emails that weve published, just about libya. its not that libya has cheap oil. she perceived the removal of gaddafi and the overthrow of the libyan state something that she would use in her runup to the general election for president. so in late 2011 there is an internal document called the libya tick tock that was produced for hillary clinton, and its the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within libya jihadists moved in, isis moved in, leading to the european refugee and migrant crisis. not only did you have people fleeing libya, people fleeing syria, the destabilization of other african countries as a result of arms flows, but the libyan state itself was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. libya faces along to the mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of africa. so all problems, economic problems and civil war in africa previously people fleeing those problems didnt end up in europe because libya policed the mediterranean. that was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by gaddafi what do these europeans think theyre doing, trying to bomb and destroy the libyan state theres going to be floods of migrants out of africa and jihadists into europe, and this is exactly what happened. john pilger you get complaints from people saying, what is wikileaks doing are they trying to put trump in the white house julian assange my answer is that trump would not be permitted to win. why do i say that because hes had every establishment off side trump doesnt have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence agencies, arms companies big foreign money are all united behind hillary clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. j ohn pilger there is the accusation that wikileaks is in league with the russians. some people say, well, why doesnt wikileaks investigate and publish emails on russia julian assange we have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to russia. most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia, most of which are critical. our russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia, which they use our documents to back up. john pilger do you yourself take a view of the u.s. election do you have a preference for clinton or trump donald trump speaking with supporters at a campaign rally at the arizona state fairgrounds in phoenix, arizona. june 18, 2016. photo by gage skidmore julian assange lets talk about donald trump. what does he represent in the american mind and in the european mind he represents american white trash, which hillary clinton called deplorable and irredeemable. it means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. because he so clearly through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies represents people who are not the middle, not the uppermiddle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting trump in any way, including any criticism of hillary clinton. if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. john pilger id like to talk about ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in london. now ecuador has cut off the internet from here where were doing this interview, in the embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the u.s. election campaign. can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on ecuadors support for you julian assange lets let go back four years. i made an asylum application to ecuador in this embassy, because of the u.s. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, i was successful in my asylum application. the embassy since then has been surrounded by police quite an expensive police operation which the british government admits to spending more than 12.6 million. they admitted that over a year ago. now theres undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of london between ecuador, a country of 16 million people, and the united kingdom, and the americans who have been helping on the side. so that was a brave and principled thing for ecuador to do. now we have the u.s. election campaign, the ecuadorian election is in february next year, and you have the white house feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. wikileaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of ecuador we publish from france, we publish from, from germany, we publish from the netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on wikileaks is through my refugee status and this is, this is really intolerable. it means that they are trying to get at a publishing organization they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the american people and others about an election. ecuadoran president rafael correa. john pilger tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. julian assange i would be immediately arrested by the british police and i would then be extradited either immediately or to sweden. in sweden i am not charged, i have already been previously cleared by the senior stockholm prosecutor eva finne. we were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the u.s. has requested since at least 2000. so over the last 15 years, every single person the u.s. has tried to extradite from sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee that wont happen. john pilger people often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. julian assange look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that theyre adaptable one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. they adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. so in my situation, frankly, im a bit institutionalized this the embassy is the world its visually the world for me. john pilger its the world without sunlight, for one thing, isnt it julian assange its the world without sunlight, but i havent seen sunlight in so long, i dont remember it. john pilger yes. julian assange so, yes, you adapt. the one real irritant is that my young children they also adapt. they adapt to being without their father. thats a hard, hard adaption which they didnt ask for. john pilger do you worry about them julian assange yes, i worry about them i worry about their mother. john pilger some people would say, well, why dont you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to sweden julian assange the u.n. the united nations working group on arbitrary detention has looked into this whole situation. they spent 18 months in formal, adversarial litigation. so its me and the u.n. versus sweden and the u.k. whos right the u.n. made a conclusion that i am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the united kingdom and sweden, and that those countries must obey. it is an illegal abuse. it is the united nations formally asking, whats going on here what is your legal explanation for this assange says that you should recognize his asylum. and here is sweden formally writing back to the united nations to say, no, were not going to recognize the un ruling, so leaving open their ability to extradite. i just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publicly in the press, because it doesnt suit the western establishment narrative that yes, the west has political prisoners, its a reality, its not just me, theres a bunch of other people as well. the west has political prisoners. of course, no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. they dont call them political prisoners in china, they dont call them political prisoners in azerbaijan and they dont call them political prisoners in the united states, u.k. or sweden it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of selfperception. julian assange here we have a case, the swedish case, where i have never been charged with a crime, where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum. those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric john pilger yes, its different. julian assange the rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that i have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that i have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. the rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the u.n. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, i am subject to persecution by the united states. john pilger is an australianbritish journalist based in london. pilgers web site is www.johnpilger.com . to support julian assange, go to httpsjustice4assange.comdonate.html\n",

      "(<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'former dea prescription head drops a bombshell congress protects big pharma fuels opioid crisis'>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'former dea prescription head drops a bombshell congress protects big pharma fuels opioid crisis source claire bernish congress would rather protect the profits of pharmaceutical companies than the health of those addicted to dangerous opioid drugs, says a former head of the dea responsible for preventing abuse of medications. joseph rannazzisi, former deputy assistant administrator at the u.s. drug enforcement agency, asserts big pharma and its lobbyists have a stranglehold on legislators in congress and have engineered the protection of a 9 billion per year industry over the health of american citizens, according to a report from the guardian . congress would rather listen to people who had a profit motive rather than a public health and safety motive, he said, according to the outlet. as long as the industry has this stranglehold through lobbyists, nothings going to change. rannazzisi explained lobbyists have spent millions thwarting legislative and policy efforts to provide guidelines for reducing the prescribing of opioid medications closely related to heroin and helped limit the deas powers to discipline those who dispense unusually high dosages of the same. a pharmacist himself, rannazzisi severely criticized lawmakers he claims hold a double standard publicly vowing to combat the opioid epidemic, while essentially working on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to ensure the industrys profits. these congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for reelection, its a sham, he told the guardian . the congressmen and senators who are championing this fight, the ones who really believe in what theyre doing, their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence. with the unique insight of having been an insider, rannazzisi excoriated the duplicity evidenced between legislators public lamentation of addiction and deaths from the opioid crisis during election years, and private efforts to protect drugmakers from liability. and he would know. according to rannazzisis linkedin profile, as chief of diversion, he had been tasked with oversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspections and civil and criminal investigations of approximately 1.6 million dea registrants but if the standards are lowered by congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids, the threshold of criminality is raised. as the guardian points out, legislation to fight the opioid epidemic, comprehensive addiction and recovery act , did, in fact, pass in july but partisan controversy erupted when republicans failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth. democrats then issued a report titled dying waiting for treatment in response, which likened the republican response to the opioid crisis to using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam. indeed the report sharply criticized the bill, equating its policies to empty promises for the lack of financial followthrough. as the washington post detailed in a report earlier this month, the dea launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturers to illegal pill mills and corrupt pharmacies, who cared little whether the drugs wound up on the streets. headed by rannazzisi, the office of diversion control sent investigators into the field, and began issuing hefty fines and filing lawsuits against the distributors responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the streets. but the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry fearing a potential significant loss in profits fought back. hard. according to the post , the deputy attorney general summoned rannazzisi to a meeting in 2012, concerning the cases of two unnamed major drug companies. that meeting was to chastise me for going after industry, and thats all that meeting was about, the nowretired dea official told the post . then, in 2014, came what constituted a hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the department of justice and congressional legislators the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act legislation initiated by the healthcare distribution management association the industry group representing distributors at the heart of the controversy. an analysis of lobbying records by the post found the healthcare distribution alliance, spent 13 million lobbying house and senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between 2014 and 2016. rannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffers in a phone conference in july 2014, and recalled telling them, this bill passes the way its written we wont be able to get immediate suspension orders, we wont be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations. stunned at the massive and ultimately successful effort to take the bite out of dea attempts to hold distributors and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take 19,000 lives every year, rannazzisi likened the legislation to a free pass for legal drug pushers. this doesnt ensure patient access and it doesnt help drug enforcement at all, he told the guardian. what this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process. what this bill does is take away deas ability to go after a pharmacist, a wholesaler, manufacturer or distributor. this was a gift. a gift to the industry, he added. after heading the diversion office for a decade, rannazzisi retired in 2015 likely disgusted over legislators dedication to the legal drug industry, rather than the people whose interests theyre ostensibly obligated to protect. the bill passed because big pharma wanted it to pass, he told the guardian in no uncertain terms. the dea is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency. when i was in charge what i tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and theyre not going to like being regulated. big pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyists filling the coffers of politicians to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation. as the center for public integrity found , the guardian noted, purdue pharma at the heart of the epidemic for its highlyaddictive drug introduced in the late 1990s, oxycontin spent a breathtaking 740 million in the last ten years on congressional lobbying efforts. however, big pharmas power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying the governmentrun interagency pain research coordinating committee iprcc has been accused by sen. ron wyden of being a tool to weaken cdc guidelines for limiting overprescribing of opioids. wyden wrote to secretary of health and human services sylvia burwell of his concerns the iprcc had been staffed with experts with conflicts of interest for their close ties to big pharma, including a scientist with a 1.5 million endowment from purdue, reported the guardian . youve got a panel thats certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing. thats something youve got to root out, wyden asserted . the role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly. science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests. families of countless addicts and victims of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of big pharmas proopioid cash appalling yet it continues to this day. policies and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem, which swirls out of control while politicians and drugmakers reap bloodtainted profits. corporations have no conscience, rannazzisi flatly told the guardian . unfortunately, with my job, i was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids. if one of those ceos went out there and talked to anybody, or if one of those ceos happened to lose a kid to this horrible, horrible domestic tragedy we have, id bet you theyd change their mind. when you sit with a parent who cant understand why theres so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace, and why isnt the government doing anything, well the dea was doing something. unfortunately what were trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws. share this
